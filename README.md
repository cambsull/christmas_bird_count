# Christmas Bird Count for Lewiston, Idaho Audubon Society

## General

This is a website designed for a client in Lewiston, Idaho. The purpose of this site is to provide local residents around Lewiston with a connection to their local Audubon chapter, and to highlight the Christmas Bird Count program run by the Audubon Society.

## Personnel

Engineering, design, initial deployment: Cambria Sullivan

Maintenance: Jim Jamison

## Technologies Used

The site is designed with HTML, CSS, and ES6 JavaScript ("Vanilla" JavaScript). React was considered, but was deemed unnecessary for the needs of the client and scope of the site. Additionally, using a vanilla tech stack will enable the client to more easily convert the site to a platform that will enable ongoing content management, should they wish to do so in the future.

Google Forms powers the contact form.

Netlify deploys the site.

Git is used for version control.

GitHub is used to host versions.
